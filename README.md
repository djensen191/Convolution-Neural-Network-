# Convolution-Neural-Network
This project is a work in progress using a Convolution Neural Network to extract features from open source Radio Frequency data. 

The project implements a Convolution Neural Network in Python3 and Pytorch.  The goal is to read in radio frequency fingerprint data from the LoRA dataset and
train the Convolutional Neural Network on it, then to show that the trained model can identidfy specific devices based on unique radio frequency characteristics.
Because of size limitations I am still working on a way to upload or link the dataset files.  The dataset files are open source for experiementation.
